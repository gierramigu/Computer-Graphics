Small Report:

The inputs I used to create the images that I've screenshotted was through
figuring out how to add the lighting and colour which I just did by modifying 
the shader programs and added uniform variables to store the light and colour values. 

I used istringstream and scanf specifically or the face values to read through the objfile 
and used opengl to create buffers in the gpu so the shaders can take in the values and 
render them on the screen.
